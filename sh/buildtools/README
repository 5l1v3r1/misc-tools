This files are small helpers while building:
     (a) a c++/c program or any other language that produces binaries 
     	 - supports make cmake automake
     (b) a debian package revolving around a c/c++ binary that can be checked on linked 
     	 libraries so dependencies can be tracked fast and easy.

To find out what packages you depend on just do
     debiandependend.sh $binary
and get a small list of all packages its linked agains and which version is installed as a minimum version.
See packages.txt as an examble list.
