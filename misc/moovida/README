This is an example on writing HID files for bluetooth
enabled devices that are capable of HID keyboard input 
such as SonyEricsson k800i or earlier k7xx series mobile
phones from SonyEricsson.

*.hid files basically consist of a tar archive with a
XML-based *.kcf file defining the keyboard codes sent 
to the bluetooth reciever and the buttons that trigger the 
keyboard events. 
Additionally to help the user along it contains a png which
is displayed to the user during the remote control process.
