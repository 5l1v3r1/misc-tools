All software,source files, images etc. is free to use under 
the terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. 
You will find a copy of the License with your clone of this repository.

A place for sharing design concepts, program snippets , 
helpful applications and develop new things. 

All the innovation seen over the last years in application Development 
wasn't made by the big companies but by groups of independent developers
who loved what they do and did it for fun.

This is one of my Key-concepts about this whole repository.

Although I'm not yet a really good programmer i struggle to get better  every day
and try to make something new everyday.

So for everyone who is intrested in sharing thoughts and creating new stuff
shall be welcomed to this repository.
